## Quantum Tales

Explore the world of quantum through the lens of classic fairy tales. Thanks to the generous support of the [Unitary Fund](https://unitary.fund), I am able to write this book and relate algorithms to fanciful situations. My goal is to demonstrate interesting qualities and applications of quantum computing in *real* life.

### Google Docs

The book is written in Google Docs to encourage collaboration. There are two links:

1. For [viewing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT3NCX_vxVFPs9MaIklmZPWSlavLx6xckD1nEhfFOatyTBd1ldaS0SOeWwFzA4zGv_FjrPP4Y0NFN96/pub)
2. For [editing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nlGzXv09roHMtTjlJQhJ6ZnwWMDHeGKi_Xnk8mygjEw/)

### PDF Format

The book is offered in a beautiful PDF complete with illustrations from the talented [Larissa Sharina](https://www.fiverr.com/vect_hbg). It is available [here](https://github.com/splch/quantum-tales/blob/master/Quantum%20Tales.pdf).

### GitHub Repository

All other code samples and notes are in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/splch/quantum-tales). This project is ongoing and will expand as more tales are related to more algorithms. So, feel free to make a pull request and have your name added to the illustrious list of contributors!
