## Quantum Tales

Explore the world of quantum through the lens of classic fairy tales. Thanks to the generous support of the [Unitary Fund](https://unitary.fund), I am able to write this book and relate algorithms to fanciful situations. My goal is to demonstrate interesting qualities and applications of quantum computing in *real* life.

Upcoming stories:

1. What Came of Picking Flowers
  * Bernstein-Vazirani
2. The Lady, or the Tiger?
  * Superposition

### Google Docs

The book is written in Google Docs to encourage collaboration. There are two links:
