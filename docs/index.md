## Quantum Tales

Explore the world of quantum through the lens of classic fairy tales. Thanks to the generous support of the [Unitary Fund](https://unitary.fund), I am able to write this book and relate algorithms to fanciful situations. My goal is to demonstrate interesting qualities and applications of quantum computing in _real_ life.

For each story, I include its inspiration in the `sources/` directory. If you're unfamiliar with a tale, I recommend that you read the original story. This project is serving two goals: one is to bring quantum to more audiences, and the other is to spread countries' stories across borders.

Upcoming stories:

1. What Came of Picking Flowers

   - Bernstein-Vazirani

2. The Lady, or the Tiger?

   - Superposition

3. The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter

   - Variational Quantum Eigensolver

4. The Red and Blue Coat

   - Many-Worlds Interpretation

5. TBD

   - Interference

### Google Docs

The book is written in Google Docs to encourage collaboration. If there is something that doesn't make sense or an improvement you'd like to make, please leave suggestions in the Google Doc. I have a strict method for the writing that can be in Quantum Tales, so I exert the right to edit any suggestion.

There are two links:

1. For [viewing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT3NCX_vxVFPs9MaIklmZPWSlavLx6xckD1nEhfFOatyTBd1ldaS0SOeWwFzA4zGv_FjrPP4Y0NFN96/pub)
2. For [editing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nlGzXv09roHMtTjlJQhJ6ZnwWMDHeGKi_Xnk8mygjEw/)

### PDF Format

Quantum Tales is offered as a beautiful PDF, complete with illustrations from the talented [Larissa Sharina](https://www.fiverr.com/vect_hbg). It is available [here](https://github.com/splch/quantumtales/blob/master/Quantum%20Tales.pdf).

If you'd prefer to preview it, this frame is hosted from Adobe.
