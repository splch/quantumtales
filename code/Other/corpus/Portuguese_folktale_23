 When the Holy Virgin was fleeing into Egypt to escape the persecutions of Herod, the Codorniz bird flew about making a great racket, calling out, "Come this way." 
 "Keep quiet!" cried the Virgin. "Our enemies will hear you! They will come in pursuit!" 
 In spite of her words the Codorniz kept up its noise. 
 "My curse be upon you," said the Virgin. "You shall always walk humbly. You shall never fly high and smile at the sun." 
 To this very day the Codorniz bird walks humbly. It has many enemies who love to slay it to devour.
