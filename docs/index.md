# Quantum Tales

Explore the world of quantum through the lens of classic fairy tales. In this project, we relate quantum algorithms to fanciful situations in order to demonstrate interesting qualities and applications of quantum computing in real life.

## About the Book

Thanks to the generous support of the [Unitary Fund](https://unitary.fund), Quantum Tales is available as a beautiful PDF complete with illustrations from the talented [Larissa Sharina](https://www.fiverr.com/vect_hbg). The PDF is available for download [here](https://quantumtales.org/quantumtales.pdf).

For each story, I include its inspiration in the `sources/` directory. If you're unfamiliar with a tale, I recommend that you read the original story. This project is serving two goals: one is to bring quantum to more audiences, and the other is to spread countries' stories across borders.

### Google Docs

The book is written in Google Docs to encourage collaboration. If there is something that doesn't make sense or an improvement you'd like to make, please leave suggestions in the Google Doc.

If you enjoy the project, you can help fund more illustrations by purchasing the hardcover [here](). The printing is of the highest quality, bringing the illustrations and story to a timeless medium.

### GitHub Repository

All other code samples and notes are in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/splch/quantumtales). This project is ongoing and will expand as more tales are related to more algorithms. So, feel free to make a pull request and have your name added to the illustrious list of contributors!
